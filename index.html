						The last two, almost three years I’ve been learning programming actively as a freelancer (most of the time in personal projects) and the process although it has been rough and full of what seemed at that time dead ends also has been incredibly satisfying seeing my apps doing whatever I can imagine with the only restrain being the lack of knowledge witch I think is pretty common in this regard.
					</p>
					<p>
						My experience so far in learning has been mostly in mobile development in Java, and an angular project in which I worked at the end of the last year I just learned the bare minimum to modify a template and get my site working.
					</p>
					<p>
						I recently got knee surgery so the majority of the time I’ve spent the beginning of this year has been programming in personal projects and at the same time with this Boot Camp which I know it will help me finish that angular project and with that so many more.

					</p>
					<p>
						In the other hand im a pretty passionate guy so the time im not programming Im usually playing RPG video games, those are my favorite and also I love practicing sports like Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Muay Thai, Basketball, Skating (that’s what brought me to my current knee state) which im anxious to practice as soon as posible.
